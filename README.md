# TicTacReact

This project is part of my learning journey to review some react concepts and apply what I have learnt in this [course](https://www.udemy.com/share/101Way3@e8EpiVgpa4yAGBPlY5OfAVHoqqPoV3FtIxfQQsqBUzmbmgHIsC9m_BPMvZXInie1QA==/).
This project is linked through a simple CD process with [Render](https://render.com/) so always any master update will be deployed here:

Note: The game screen is not UI reponsive friendly
